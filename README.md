# basicTraveler

This app is essentially a blog for my coding roadtrip.

## background

I've spent the last year working/learning to code at Galvanize. It has easliy been one of the best experiences of my life but all good things must come to an end. In October of 2016 I found myself without a job, lease, or significant other,
so,
it's time to travel.

## The App

The App is essentially a blog that tracks where I am in the world and where each entry is coming from. It is also connected to instagram and shows the pictures I take along the way.
